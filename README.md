# Weather Information App

This Python script fetches weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)
- OpenWeatherMap API key (get it from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/))

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the script `weather_app.py`.
2. Install the required library: `pip install requests`.
3. Obtain your OpenWeatherMap API key and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the script with your actual API key.

```python
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

4. Run the script: `python weather_app.py`.
5. Enter the name of the city when prompted.

## Example

```bash
Enter city: New York
```

The script will then print detailed weather information for the specified city.

## Note

- Ensure you have an active internet connection.
